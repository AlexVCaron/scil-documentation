International events
--------------------

OHBM
    - Organization for Human Brain Mapping  `(OHBM) <https://www.humanbrainmapping.org>`_
    - Presents researches on **anatomical and functional organization** of the human brain. It is a half-method, half-application conference working on strenghtening the translational research. It concerns **all imaging methods** (MRI, PET, EEG, etc.). We generally see more functional than diffusion MRI.
    - **Annual** international conference since 1995. Last conferences: Italy, Singapore, Canada, Switzerland.

        - `OHBM 2020 <https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3958>`_, was planned in Montreal, Canada (June 27 - July 1). It will now be offered completely online due to the COVID-19 situation.
        - OHBM 2021 will be held in Seoul, Korea (June 27 - July 1)
        - OHBM 2022 will be held in Glasglow, Scotland (June 19 - 23)

MICCAI
    - The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society `(MICCAI) <http://www.miccai.org/>`_
    - There are two components: The MIC - **medical image** and the CAI - **computer assisted intervention and robotics**. It is also a half-method, half-application conference, but the applications often use more sophisticated techniques so the **methods** are very important. You can generally see a lot of mathematics and deep learning techniques, although this is now also present in MIDL. The workshops surrounding the events are often very strong, and there are also many challenges organized in that period.
    - **Annual** international meeting since 1998. Last conferences: China, Spain. Canada, Greece.

        - `MICCAI 2020 <https://www.miccai2020.org/en>`_ will be held in Lima, Peru (Oct 4 - Oct 8)
        - MICCAI 2021 will be held in Strasbourg, France (Sept 27 - Oct 1)
        - MICCAI 2022 will be held in Singapore (Sept 18 - Sept 22)

ISMRM
    - The International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine `(ISMRM) <https://www.ismrm.org>`_
    - This conference only presents the **MRI modalities** and, like MICCAI, focuses a lot on the methods even if it is a half-method, half-application conference.
    - **Annual** international conference since 1994. Last conferences: Canada, France, Hawai'i, Singapore.

        - `ISMRM 2020 <https://www.ismrm.org/20m/>`_ was planned in Sydney, Australia (April 18 - April 23) but will be held August 8-13 in Paris due to the COVID-19 situation.
        - ISMRM 2021 will be held in Vancouver, Canada (May 15 - May 20)
        - ISMRM 2022 will be held in London, England (May 7 - May 12)

MIDL
    - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (`MIDL <https://www.midl.io>`_)
    - As the name says, a conference combining **medical imaging** and **deep learning**. Contrary to other conferences, *all* presentations are in this multi-disciplinary field.
    - **Annual** internation conference since 2018. Last conferences: Netherlands, England.

        - `MIDL 2020 <https://2020.midl.io>`_ was planned in Montreal, Canada (July 6 - July 8) but will now be online due to the COVID-19 situation.
        - MIDL 2021 will be held in Lübeck, Germany (July 7 - July 9)

Dipy workshop
    - DIPY offers an **annual** workshop which is a good way to get acquainted with DIPY. It is held in Indiana (Indiana University is DIPY's main sponsor) around March.

        - 2021's edition is not announced yet. Here's the link to `2020's workshop <https://workshop.dipy.org>`_ (which was cancelled due to the COVID-19).
