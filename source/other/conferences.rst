International events
--------------------

OHBM
    - Organization for Human Brain Mapping  `(OHBM) <https://www.humanbrainmapping.org>`_
    - Presents researches on **anatomical and functional organization** of the human brain. It is a half-method, half-application conference working on strenghtening the translational research. It concerns **all imaging methods** (MRI, PET, EEG, etc.). We generally see more functional than diffusion MRI.
    - **Annual** international conference since 1995. Last conferences: Italy, Singapore, Canada, Switzerland. 2020 and 2021 editions were virtual due to COVID-19.

MICCAI
    - The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society `(MICCAI) <http://www.miccai.org/>`_
    - There are two components: The MIC - **medical image** and the CAI - **computer assisted intervention and robotics**. It is also a half-method, half-application conference, but the applications often use more sophisticated techniques so the **methods** are very important. You can generally see a lot of mathematics and deep learning techniques, although this is now also present in MIDL. The workshops surrounding the events are often very strong, and there are also many challenges organized in that period.
    - **Annual** international meeting since 1998. Last conferences: China, Spain. Canada, Greece. MICCAI 2020 and 2021 were virtual due to COVID-19.

ISMRM
    - The International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine `(ISMRM) <https://www.ismrm.org>`_

    Main Conference

        - This conference only presents the **MRI modalities** and, like MICCAI, focuses a lot on the methods even if it is a half-method, half-application conference.
        - **Annual** international conference since 1994. Last conferences: Canada, France, Hawai'i, Singapore. ISMRM 2020 and 2021 were virtual due to COVID-19.

    Diffusion study group Workshop:

        - A conference organized from time to time. Last one was in Amsterdam in 2022. In was the first occurance in many years. https://www.ismrm.org/workshops/2022/Diffusion/

MIDL
    - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (`MIDL <https://www.midl.io>`_)
    - As the name says, a conference combining **medical imaging** and **deep learning**. Contrary to other conferences, *all* presentations are in this multi-disciplinary field.
    - **Annual** international conference since 2018. Last conferences: Netherlands, England. MIDL 2020 and 2021 were virtual due to COVID-19.

Dipy workshop
    - DIPY offers an **annual** workshop which is a good way to get acquainted with DIPY. It is held in Indiana (Indiana University is DIPY's main sponsor) around March. Link here: `2022's workshop <https://dipy.org/workshops/dipy-workshop-2022>`_.

I AM BRAIN
    - New association. Their first event will be in April 2023.

Local events
------------

RBIQ-QBIN
    - `RBIQ <https://www.rbiq-qbin.qc.ca/Home>`_ in French (Réseau de bio-imagerie du Québec), QBIN in English (Quebec Bio-imaging Network). It is a good opportunity to meet the imaging community of our province.
    - **Annual** scientific day in Montreal. Link here: `scientific day <https://www.rbiq-qbin.qc.ca/Journ%C3%A9e_scientifique_annuelle>`_.

UNIQUE
    - The Unifying Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence - Québec (`UNIQUE <https://sites.google.com/view/unique-neuro-ai/>`_). They sometime offer scientific days or student symposiums. Ex: https://unique-students.github.io/2022/schedule.
    - See all activities `here <https://sites.google.com/view/unique-neuro-ai/activities>`_.

MAIN
    - Unique helps organizing the **annual** MAIN event (Montreal Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience) with UdeM since 2017.

Symposium Imagining Imaging
    - Was first held in 2014 for the opening of our new Imaging Center at the CHUS and will now again be held this year. Keynote speakers from all around the world.
    - Link for `2020's edition <https://www.fourwav.es/view/2000/info/>`_.
