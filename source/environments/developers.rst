Using environments
------------------

Why
####

What is an environment? Why should you use one?

Most of the libraries we use and the programs we code are made in python. But also, most of
the programs in Linux are based in python. We want to make sure that when we work, install
libraries, uninstall libraries, etc., we don’t break your Linux installation! Environments
are a good way to separate the libraries you use for developing code from your computer’s
basic libraries.

How?

There are many options for environments. One very famous option is the Anaconda/conda world,
but in the lab, we have experienced some issues with it. We highly recommand using virtualEnv:
