Users of our tools
==================

Discover our singularities
##########################

We have prepared most of our tools in a way that users don’t need to install too many dependencies
on their computer. It saves you time and energy! The way to do that is to « wrap » the tool into a
singularity, which you can see as en environment already all up-to-date and ready to use.
See the :ref:`singularity` tab for more information on singularities.

Discover our Nextflows
##########################

Also, most of our tools are offered as a « Nexflow ». That means that we have already created
pipelines (a list of the numerous steps to process your data, for example) that will run easily
on your computer in a computationally efficient, robust and reproducible way. The goal is that
two users, running the same job on two different computers at two different moments, should obtain
the same results! See the :ref:`nextflow` tab for a more detailed explanation.
