Mi-Brain
========

`Mi-Brain <https://github.com/imeka/mi-brain/releases>`_ is a GUI viewer developped by `IMEKA <https://imeka.ca/>`_ (a Sherbrooke company for diffusion analysis co-founded by Maxime Descoteaux and Pierre-Marc Jodoin).

To install it, click on the Mi-Brain link above and download it from the github. For Linux, unzip the folder where you want it to be, and add this to your .bashrc: alias MI-Brain='bash path_to_the_extracted_folder/MI-Brain.sh'. Replace 'path_to_the_extracted_folder' with the actual path on your computer.


\* Other useful viewers: mrview (see MRtrix), `tracvis <http://trackvis.org/download/>`_.

\* Pro tip: viewing your data in more than one viewer may help ensuring your data is correctly saved (good header, good directions, etc.).
